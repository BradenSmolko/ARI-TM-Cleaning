I do not know what is going on."" He told me "" stop being soft. you are being soft."" I am ""No I am being serious."" And they were ""No you are being soft."" So then the next two days I had to do PT that. And I still did it. I I did not complain. I still did what I had to do. And then but every day I would show up to the hospital and tell my doctor ""there is something really wrong with my back."" They took an X ray. They did not see anything. So even he said ""you are lying."" He did not believe me. ""No you are trying to get out of PT."" I was ""No I am a PT stud. Why would I even I do not have a reason to get out."" So and then they are you know what? He was okay. He made me promise him my doctor he was ""You promise me that you are really hurt."" I was ""Sir why would I lie? I I you have never even seen me you know. you have never really even seen me before."" So I was ""So why would I even lie?"" And then come to find out they took an MRI . and I have for discs in my spine that that are protruding that collapsed that are damaged. So I but I have to get the MRI off post. So a a Korean doctor said he called my doctor. He was ""Man how long has he been this?"" ""It happened in June 29th June 29th 2015."" He was ""How long has he been this?"" He was ""Man probably a week."" He was ""He needs surgery right now."" So within four days after that conversation I was I was under the knife getting surgery because it was they said my my spine was about to collapse on itself. So and it is because nobody believed me now now I got to walk around with a and and because I did what I was supposed to do. I did not ask any questions. I did not I did not "" you know why are they doing that? I am doing this."" I was ""Roger Sergeant. Roger Sergeant."" I got it done. I said I am messed up for the rest of my life but I got it done.

You know, and, and it brought the morale of the team down, because people were like, “Well, maybe not everybody goes and respects that and uses that time to go work out, but I do.” Like for example, in my personal case, I have two children. And so, as a mother, when you get home like you don’t have time for yourself. 

	You get home and it’s like you just continue your work. It’s a different type of work, but you just continue. And it doesn’t stop until you choose to go to bed.

	Um, then we would have meetings. Every Friday morning, actually, we would have meetings.

	So we would stay there and we would discuss ways and things of—to bring the morale back and up, but we would never do anything about it. It was like a waste of time.

What was coming out of his mouth was different than what his actions—
Interviewee:	In a way. So to get to my personal story, what really affected me is when I was about to leave from there, I had plenty of, uh, days, like leave—that’s what we call it—days off that we earned. And so I had plenty of that, and I wanted to take some time to just relax and kind of, you know, forget about the dental clinic for a little bit and kind of get my mind ready for this new assignment.

	And I had the time, so, you know, it was not an issue. Like I had days to burn pretty much. So I made my request the way that I was supposed to, but he wouldn’t grant them. And my immediate supervisor kept telling me, like, “Hey, well, it’s up to him. I can’t do anything. It’s up to him.” 

	And one day I was just like, “You know, like do you guys ever like take the time to even ask me like, ‘Hey, how come you want two weeks off?’” Like, I mean, it’s not unusual. People usually take two, sometimes even more, time off before they transition somewhere else. It’s just a healthy thing to do.

	And, you know, I have the time. I am here every day. I do my work. I’ve been here almost six years, ‘cause that’s how long I was almost there at the clinic. And I’m like, “You guys don’t really know me, but I don’t want to be boasting, but I don’t get in trouble. I do what I gotta do. I help when I can, like why? Why are you not granting these two weeks?”
Interviewee:	Exactly. Exactly. With that, along with what I was just telling you, it’s like, “What?” And so I told my immediate supervisor. I said, “Ma’am, how do you know that—let’s just say, have you asked me every how I’m doing at home and why I need this time off? What if I were to tell you that I’m going through a divorce right now? You would have no clue.” You know, like, why? Because you don’t ask. 

	And I said—and I just pretty much—and I said, “With all due respect, ma’am, you guys don’t even care.” I said, “You guys talk about all this, you know, we care about our people and let’s bring up the morale and stuff like that, but here I am asking you, which I think it’s fair, for two days—or two weeks off. You have nothing for me to do anymore, because I already passed on all my responsibilities to the next person that’s gonna take them over. I feel like I’ve done what I have to do.”

	I said, “You’re waiting on him to make the decision. Well, I want to know what he wants in order for me to have this time off.” So finally, after like—after that talk and I told her, I said, “You know, you don’t even know what’s going on in my life, because you never ask.” And I said, “I’m not the only one that feels like that.” Then I said, um, “You know, just let me know what I need to do, because I need time off.”","kbeavan",2000-07-02 15:24:00,4498,7.168127,"Yeah.

Mike In the initial case it was agreed upon that “We’re gonna view this and destroy it.” Destroy it and we’ll call it good because nobody got hurt and everything was fine “Ha ha it was a joke we get it ” and yeah. Mike I got you. Then he went Mike You said it was the officer in charge that did that not the flying pilot but the officer in charge? No with the officer in charge of us yeah. Mike I got you okay. In that case there was a trust violation.

Mike:	Okay, so the Navy promotes being physically fit, and then –

Interviewee:	Yeah, and then they don’t really enforce it.

Mike:	I got you.

Interviewee:	Somebody will be like, “Well, he’s a chief,” or, “I’ll” – another chief well be like, “Hey, let me make sure, I’ll write down his measurements. I got this one,” instead of you actually taking the measurements for somebody else, and you know it’s clearly out, but they’re just hooking him up because he’s a chief.

You see the leaders that are coming, like, “You need to be at PT,” and you’re like, “No, you need to be at PT,” stuff like that. I think there’s definitely favoritism for stuff like that, just those basics.

Mike:	Got you. Any other big Navy value stuff that you don’t really see?

Interviewee:	I’ve seen guys get kicked out for higher tenure, not making rank, even though they really know the job really well and they’re really good sailors, they just didn’t conform to – they fit in that good guy club, so they didn’t get the evals that they should have, even though they’re probably a really solid sailor.

Then, you’ll lose guys to attrition, or the enlisted review board that they have, they’ll look at people, and they’ll be like, “Alright, well, it’s time for you to go. You haven’t been promoting fast enough. Have a nice day.”

Mike:	I got you. Then, again, you initially had started with that, too, about the promotion system. What you’re saying right now, that guy hit higher tenure, he wasn’t this the good club. Was that because, like you said, he didn’t get the right evaluations because he wasn’t – before, you had said it’s based on the time that you’re in, not necessarily your performance. Did he –

Interviewee:	Right. You could have a really good performance, but you may not fit the mold of what they wanted, so you won’t get the good eval.

Mike:	I got you, okay.

Interviewee:	I had guys that when I checked into my last command, luckily, I fell into the good guys club, so I got qualified quickly just being a senior guy in general, but there are other senior guys there that didn’t get qualified. It took them two years to get qualified. They be like, “What the hell? Why did you get qualified so fast, and I’ve been here forever. I was next in line.” I’ll be like, “I don’t know.”

Mike:	Yeah, I got you.

Interviewee:	“Maybe it’s because your PT scores suck, you don’t really listen, stuff like that, even though you should have been qualified way before me.

Mike:	I got you.

Interviewee:	Stuff like that.

Mike:	Okay, so basically falling into the “right crowd,” you get access to different, like in that case, earlier quals, and that helps your performance evaluation.

Interviewee:	Correct, yeah

Mike:	Okay, whereas if you’re not in that crowd, you never really get that opportunity sooner rather than later.

Interviewee:	Mm-hmm.

Mike:	Okay. Now, how about that person that didn’t get that opportunity? They eventually become a senior person in the squadron. Do they ever get the chance to have that top eval because they’ve been there for so long?

Interviewee:	Possibly, but usually not. I probably jumped six or seven people. They were junior to me, had been in the squadron longer, but I just completely just –

Mike:	Because you had fit into the right crowd.

Interviewee:	Right, and luckily, the crowd I was in, I jumped some of those guys that were in the crowd, but since I feel like, “Well, we talked about it,” and they liked me, and they knew, “Okay, well, you do know what you’re talking about, and you have been, and you’re gonna be closer to higher tenure than I am,” then yeah, it doesn’t bother them.

	If it was somebody they didn’t like and had jumped them for some reason and they got the better eval, they would have been pissed. They would have been like, “Why does this guy get it? Blah, blah, blah. I don’t care if he’s senior. He doesn’t know more than me.” That type of thing.

Mike:	They were looking at you, they liked you, so they were okay with it.

Interviewee:	They were okay. They understood the basic – now, they may not have agreed with it or been too thrilled, but not enough to really care. I think overall, they were fine with it. Had they had a big fit about it, I would have heard, or somebody else would have heard, and they would have been like, “This is bullshit. Why the fuck does he get the eval,” and everything else.

Mike:	Okay. Then, also, you mentioned higher tenure. I just wanna clarify what the difference there is.

Interviewee:	A higher tenure is an E5 that has not made E6 within 14 years of being in the Navy. I’m actually approaching higher tenure.

Mike:	That means what? You –

Interviewee:	If I hit my 14-year mark in the Navy, and I’m still an E5, it’s, “Here’s your severance pay. Have a nice day.”

Mike:	Oh, you have to get out of the Navy.

Interviewee:	Yeah because you hit your higher tenure because you’ve been there too long, and at the current rate, you’re stale where you’re at, so you need to – it’s time to go.

Mike:	I got you. When you had said they were more okay with it because you were closer to higher tenure, they were sorta understanding that –

Interviewee:	That, “Hey, we know he needs this eval because he is a good sailor. We want him to stay in,” as opposed to if it was somebody junior that jumped up, they’re like, “Why does he get it? I’m the senior guy,” type of thing.

Mike:	Okay. In all of that stuff, you had initially said about the performances system some people are rewarded for being there more time versus performance.

Interviewee:	Right. I think I may have lucked into part of that, which works out for me, which I’m not gonna complain.

Mike:	Yeah, definitely, but then some performance was in there as well, it sounds like.

I do not remember. But Yeah. they are they are these mountain ranges not ranges but mountains that it goes this big hill and then next is an even bigger hill and then the next even bigger hill. And a bunch of squads to take their freshmen up there and kind of do workouts on it. And it is really hard workouts. yeah. And what happens is sometimes it would snow or it would ice and they would take them up there anyway and people would get injured and they would fall and they would hurt their ankle or pull a muscle. And it was the type of environment that was not safe and I think that they sometimes people think that the freshman class is not getting enough training. Their their training is wimpy. if you have ever heard that the freshman class each year always has it easy and the class before them was always had it harder. that is kind of what people say. When it was hard is one of the most sayings here. Yeah so they mean if you are a freshman now people will talk about training "" your training was not even hard. we had to do this this and this when we were in training "" and stuff. So I think sometimes Yeah sometimes they try to make it as hard as possible to try to make it hard. And at times that could be dangerous. and I have definitely heard of of people getting injured because of that. "

And he’s made a joke that was about the same or I’d say probably worse than whatever the guy said the day before. So. Yeah it was a while ago. I don’t remember exactly but I know it was bad and it was a bunch of guys and me standing there. And he looked at me. It was “ I probably shouldn’t have done that.” I think a lot of the things that I notice is they give us a lot of rules here but I feel the most I’ve learned is to see which rules I have to follow all the time see which ones are you know flexible for the situation I’m in. So if I’m not wearing my civilian my uniform at a concert in D.C. that would make sense. But so if I were to get put in the system I feel my company leadership would be “Hey well that would be kind of ridiculous to wear your uniform to a concert you know? So we’re not gonna fry you for that. We wo won’t let that happen because it’s not realistic.” So I feel a lot of leadership here is encouraged to determine which rule be reasonable with the rules you know? Not bend the rules or break the rules but how they apply to situations really matters. That’s a And kinda that game thing that you said. Yeah that’s what I was gonna say. It’s it’s a game to figure out which rules you need to follow and which rules you don’t."
